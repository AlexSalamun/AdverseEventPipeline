# AdverseEventPipeline

Data mining for drug-reaction associations is a major topic in the pharmaceutical industry. Historically the focus has been on using privately owned and maintained datasets consisting of information that has been transformed via the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) and privatized reporting systems that house the data from clinical trials. Our focus will be on building a pipeline that demonstrates an open source solution for building a drug's safety profile from data collection through signal detection. In contrast this pipeline primarily used the openFDA API and social media data available through the Reddit API with all analysis being done in the R statistical programming language. The aim was to collect the information available in these public sources and apply popular data mining methodologies used to identify and predict the occurrence of adverse events. The results show the ability of the openFDA and social media sites to create real-time drug safety occurrence profiles by applying the same statistical methods applied in clinical trials. Using social media as a source was shown to provide the best results when applied to common over-the-counter drugs as opposed to last line of defense medications.
